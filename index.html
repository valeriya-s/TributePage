      <p1>Coretta Scott King was widely known as the wife of Martin Luther King Jr. However, Coretta Scott King was a civil rights leader along with her husband, in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. In addition to her contribution for black rights, King also fought for women’s rights, LGBT rights, and against apartheid.</p1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p2>Born in Alabama, on April 27 1927, Coretta Scott King graduated valedictorian from Lincoln High School and continued her studies in Antioch College. There, she became politically involved in the campus, approximately 5 years prior to meeting her future husband. Her commitments to global peacemaking helped inspire her husband’s beliefs on nonviolence, contributing to his Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. With four kids, Coretta Scott King still actively spoke out against the Vietnam War. After Martin’s assassination, Coretta Scott King continued the fight for racial justice in honour of her husband’s death. She refused to step down and let men run things, and criticized many stereotypes put on women and especially black women. Until Scott King’s death on January 30, 2006, she continued to create her legacy and contributed to the civil rights movement.</p2>
